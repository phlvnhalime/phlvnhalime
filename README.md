# 👋 Hi there, I'm Halime Pehlivan.

🎯 I'm a mechanical engineer turned software developer, passionate about learning code and how systems work under the hood.  
🌍 Based in Heilbronn, Germany | Originally from Turkiye 🇹🇷  
📚 Student at [42 Heilbronn](https://www.42heilbronn.de/), focused on low-level programming and system design  
🚀 I’ve come a long way in C — now, I’m setting my sights on mastering C++

---

## 🧠 What I Know and Use
- 💻 Languages: C (strong), Shell, learning C++
- 🛠️ Tools: Vim, LLDB, Git, MacOS Terminal (iTerm2)
- 🧩 Projects: `get_next_line`, `push_swap`, `so_long`, `minishell`, virtual machines
- 🔐 Interests: Embedded systems, memory management, debugging, system programming

## 🔥 Highlights
- 🐚 **Minishell**  
  → A fully working shell written in C — handled parsing, process management, and signals with clean code structure  
- 📂 **get_next_line**  
  → Reads lines from a file descriptor with precision, including buffer handling and memory safety  
- 📊 **push_swap**  
  → Built an optimized sorting algorithm using two stacks and instruction minimization  
- 🎮 **so_long**  
  → Designed a C game using MiniLibX where two characters explore a spaceship — custom assets and logic included
